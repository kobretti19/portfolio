      <p>
        Originally from a small city in Macedonia, I now live in Switzerland,
        where I work as a service and repair technician for Hi-Fi audio home
        equipment. My passion for technology has always been a driving force,
        leading me to explore diverse fields—from artificial intelligence to
        penetration testing—and ultimately inspiring a career in full stack
        development, where I focus on creating engaging and impactful web
        experiences. In May 2025, I successfully completed a 1-year JavaScript
        Web Application Developer Academy, which provided me with in-depth
        knowledge of web development, coding best practices, and real-world
        project experience. Since September, I have continued expanding my skill
        set through courses such as Transact-SQL, Excel Business Intelligence
        with Power Query & DAX, Analyzing Data with Excel and Essential
        Statistics, and PL-300: Design and Manage Analytics Solutions Using
        Power BI, enhancing my analytical and business intelligence
        capabilities. Driven by curiosity and a desire to harness technology’s
        transformative power, I am committed to creating solutions that are not
        only functional but also meaningful and user-focused. My journey is one
        of continuous learning, innovation, and a passion for turning complex
        problems into accessible and impactful digital experiences.
