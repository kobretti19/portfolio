      <p>
        Originally from a small city in Macedonia, i have spent most of my life
        there, but the past few years have been a journey of growth in
        Switzerland, where i work as a service and repair technician for a
        company that specializes in Hi-Fi audio home equipment. My fascination
        with technology has been a driving force in my career and personal
        pursuits, leading me to explore the ever-evolving world of coding and
        tech. As you delved deeper into the realm of technology, my curiosity
        expanded to diverse fieldsâ€”from artificial intelligence to penetration
        testing. This exploration sparked my passion for full stack development,
        where i mastered crafting immersive and impactful online experiences.
        With a keen desire to harness the transformative power of tech, i am
        dedicated to creating solutions that resonate with users, elevating
        everyday experiences into something meaningful and inspiring. My journey
        is one of constant learning and pushing boundaries, driven by a deep
        passion for innovation and the possibilities technology can offer.
